# Live Data in VR using Unity
The Live Data in Virtual Reality project developed on Unity is an exciting project created for the class 8810 Eye Tracking II: Gaze Sensing and Interaction in XR at Clemson University in spring-2023. The project aims to combine the latest virtual reality technology to create an immersive and interactive user experience in which users can navigate the environment. Every time the userâ€™s gaze focuses on a specific object, the program will fetch a value (number) transmitted by a Web API representing the actual temperature in a water pump.
